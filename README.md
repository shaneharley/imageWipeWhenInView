# imageWipeWhenInView
##Preview: https://image-wipe-when-in-view.netlify.app/

Code to make an image apply a wipe transition when it comes into the viewport
- Detect when a section is 75% in view
- Cycle through each div in that section and reset the clipping mask to create a wipe effect
- Increase the delay slightly each time so it feels staggered
